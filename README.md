## Overview
Implementation of GraphQL Java Servlet including support for Relay.js, Apollo and OSGi out of the box.
This project wraps the Java implementation of GraphQL provided by [GraphQL Java](https://www.graphql-java.com).
See [GraphQL Java documentation](https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/latest/) for more in depth details
regarding GraphQL Java itself. 

We try to stay up to date with GraphQL Java as much as possible maintaining the retro-compatibility 
with Springframework 5.

The `14.*` version must be used if your project is based on Spring version <= `5`, 
or it is using javax-servlet-api dependency and cannot be upgraded to jakarta.

It also supports legacy projects that can compile with older JDK versions: the oldest supported one 
is the `11`.


See [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) to see currently supported versions.

## Installation and getting started

See [Getting started](https://www.graphql-java-kickstart.com/servlet/getting-started/) for more
detailed instructions.
